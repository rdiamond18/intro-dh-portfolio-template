This map is a map of the place names listed in Chapter 10 of Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire". The first layer features points retresented the place named listed. The map also features a heat map, which shows which areas were strongly represented. Unsuprisingly, the area around Rome stands out. Finally, I included a map of the Roman Empire in 200 AD, which is the closest time period I could find to 248-268 AD, which is the time period the chapter covers.

Below is a link to the map -
