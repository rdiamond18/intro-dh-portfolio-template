## Reflection

I went through the Programming Historian lesson titled “Visualizing Data with Bokeh and Pandas”. Bokeh and Pandas are two python packages which contain several built in functions that allowed me to visualize all sorts of cool data pertaining to World War II and the various battles and bombardments that took place. In the lesson, I learned how to work with DataFrames and I also learned about the various built in ways to represent data. The lesson began with more simple representations such as bar charts and histograms, but progressed to more involved ones such as geographical mapping and smoothed line charts. 

The part of the lesson I struggled most with was syntax. Learning Bokeh syntax felt like learning a new programming language. I was able to understand what each step accomplished, as everything was thankfully thoroughly explained by the website, but it will likely take some time to commit Bokeh syntax to memory.

The part I enjoyed the most was seeing the graphs come to life. There is no better feeling than clicking into a new window and seeing a numerical representation of a story that I created. I also feel like learning how to represent data will be super important for me as I plan to major in data science and I will certainly need to know how to effectively tell stories through data visualization. I feel that I should keep chipping away at learning Bokeh as it will be super useful to me in the future.
