This week, I read an article titled “Sacred reading: from Augustine to the Digital Humanists”. The article led off with a quote that I found super interesting: in 1917, Max Weber said that the world could now be understood “through calculation”. Essentially, Weber argued that because math and science had begun to invade humanistic fields, the world was reduced to science. I find it interesting that this quote was made in 1917, and we are very much still in an era where people make similar quotes. In another article we read this week called “Technology is Taking Over English Departments”, one of the people who worked on the Google Ngrams tool claimed that every field would soon be optimized via computing. When reading these articles side by side, I began to wonder if we will ever get to that point that Weber and the Ngrams creator said society is at. I feel like society can always move the needle towards technology more, but if we’re having this same debate over one hundred years later, and technology has progressed for a century and still not reduced our lives to a science, there must be a role for traditional humanities thinking.
After reading further, I found the concept of “distant reading” very interesting. Distant
Reading, based on my understanding, is a way of reading text that detaches the reader from the emotions of reading and focuses on using mathematical and logical methods to analyze texts. I feel as though arguing over whether distant reading is better than standard reading is unhelpful, and both have their place in our current dialogue. In my opinion, distant reading should be used as a tool to approximate the emotional response that readers feel. We as individuals should continue to read texts as we do, allowing ourselves to get swept up in the content. However, those who like to study fields such as historiography will find distant reading extremely helpful. I think lamenting distant reading misses its point: it isn’t a substitute for reading, but rather an additional tool we can use to better understand literature and history.
