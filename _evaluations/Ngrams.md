## Evaluation 

Google Ngrams is a tool that allows you to visualize word usage over time. The project uses the strength of Google’s searching ability to comb through a large repository of books and the years in which they were published, and then displays an aesthetically pleasing time series graph displaying the results.
I’m very curious about the technology involved in Ngrams. I believe it has to incorporate some kind of keyword search into this giant text repository. Last year, in CS15, my friend Sam and I designed a tool called ‘gerp’ which works similar to grep in linux and searches through files and directories for words. I would imagine this project uses a similar, but significantly more sophisticated tool compared to what Sam and I built.
The types of questions this tool can answer center around the question of how much certain words are used in our dialogue. While Ngrams searches through printed sources, we can generally understand a word’s popularity through the use of the Ngrams tool. For example, I was curious as to which major US sports league is the most talked about in print and if it has changed over time (result included below). Upon my search, I saw some interesting trends reflected in the Ngrams chart. The NBA seems to have had a big spike in popularity in the 1990s, which coincides with the rise and stardom of Michael Jordan. Additionally, the NFL clears the NBA by a significant margin in our more recent dialogue, cementing its status as the most popular American sports league. Google Ngrams can take a question you asked and leave you with many more upon running the tool, which is a big strength of the project.
Another strength of the project is its speed and simplicity. The visualizations are simple, the tool runs almost instantly and it is super accessible to the public and free. Any word can be input into the tool which gives it a wide range of applications.
The biggest limitation, in my opinion, of Google Ngrams is that you can’t search for a phrase longer than five words. Say you wanted to search for “Four Score and Seven Years Ago”, maybe curious about Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg Address, Ngrams wouldn’t be able to handle it. While it can handle shorter common phrases such as “constitutional amendment”, which may help visualize when people were talking about amending the constitution, longer phrases aren’t possible to search.
Overall, I really liked looking at Google Ngrams and because of its broad applicability, I will almost certainly continue to use it when I’m curious about linguistic trends or for my final project.
