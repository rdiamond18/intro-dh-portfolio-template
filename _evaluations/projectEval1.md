## Evaluation 

I evaluated the “Robots Reading Vogue” project for my first DH Project Evaluation. While this project is technically one unit, it covers a variety of topics centering around Vogue Magazine, including cover art, how the magazine itself changed over the years and how beauty has been represented over Vogue’s lifespan. This project was spearheaded by Peter Leonard, the director of the Yale Digital Humanities Library and Lindsay King, the Associate Director for Access and Research Services at Yale’s library. It has also been worked on by many Yale students over the years.
	The project uses a variety of technologies to tell stories about Vogue. These tools range from more numerical ones like Topic Modeling, a statistical way of finding the “topics” that exist in texts, to using both simple (overlaying covers of Vogue throughout the years) to complex (using ImagePlot to visualize color usage) tools to tell stories about the visual effect that Vogue gives off and what that says about beauty standards in various time periods.
	I think the project is extremely strong in that it has not just one focus. There are many layers to the project and one can go on the website and browse for a very long time. I appreciate how the creators don’t try and make one blanket argument about Vogue, but they let all the data speak for itself and let readers draw their own conclusions. Documentation for the project is also strong and each tool that is used is explained and credited. Finally, the website is sleek and visually appealing, as well as user friendly.
	One part of the project that could be improved is interactivity. For example, in the topic modeling section, a variety of words and the associated graphs that represent their frequency in Vogue are laid out. However, I think it would be really cool if readers were allowed to search for the words they wanted to find out about. This feature does exist in some parts of the project, such as the Advertisements section where users can drill down on specific company types, whether it be car companies or cosmetic brands and how they advertised in Vogue. However, I think expanding this feature could bring the website to the next level.
	Overall, I found the project fascinating and ended up looking at it for a very long time. I would be interested in looking at a similar project for Sports Illustrated, as that magazine has a very storied history just like Vogue and is one that I read often.
