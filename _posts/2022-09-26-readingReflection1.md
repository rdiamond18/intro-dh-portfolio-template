his week, I read two documents as part of my digital humanities homework. 

The first one was titled "Introduction to Digital Humanities”. The central question this paper was trying to tackle was creating a definition of Digital Humanities. However, as I'm sure often happens when trying to create definitions, the paper didn't really argue about specific definitions, but rather was more so about how difficult it is for people in the field to create a singular definition. One point I found particularly interesting was how the modern American University Structure is deeply rooted in the way older universities used to study the humanities. The paper seems to argue that the traditional way of studying the humanities is being used, no matter what field of study is being presented as part of a University Curriculum. One tenet that the author described as being part of traditional humanities scholarship is “a deep respect and imitation of ancient models”. When I read this sentence, I was reminded of how ingrained classical mechanics and Newton’s laws are in the study of Physics at Tufts. While Physics isn’t part of what most would consider “the humanities”, it still is being taught in the same style.

The second reading was titled “The Organization of Humanities Research”. One section of this chapter I found interesting was the section titled “Classification and Documentation”. This section discussed how databases are part of most humanities research currently. This makes sense, as nobody wants to write stuff out or search through books by hand when you have tools like databases and the grep command in linux to help out. This got me thinking, is every bit of humanities now digital humanities? While I’m certainly not the first to ask this question, it seems like every bit of humanities research I can think of has a technological component or can be improved by adding one. Every researcher by now most likely uses some sort of database to store the massive amount of information they look at. Whether or not every bit of humanities is digital humanities is a question I would have to look into.

The final question I had was the following: What tools are on the cutting edge of digital humanities? Past python, what packages and other programming languages are used?
